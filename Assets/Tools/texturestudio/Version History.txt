May 02, 2005	1,14	Fixed the memory access violations that
			were occurring on some computers, thanks
			to the help of Troy Robinson (aka. "Pongo").

April 29, 2005	1.13	Added the ability to load images from the
			commandline. This also allows files to be
			associated with Texture Studio, and for
			files to be dragged and dropped on to
			texture studio to load them. Also changed
			the image load function to CopyRect the
			pixels from the loaded image into a blank
			image, possibly fixing the reported
			memory access violations.

April 29, 2005	1.12	Fixed a bug in the seamless texture algorithm
			where spme "garbage" pixels would appear in some
			cases, in addition to improving the algorithm
			slightly.

April 29, 2005	1.11	Made Texture Studio more CPU efficient, so
			CPU power is efficiently shared with other
			applications currently running.

April 29, 2005	1.10	Significantly improved the perspective
			correction algorithm by eliminating the
			"blocky" look (with linear filtering added)

April 28, 2005	1.01	Slightly improved the Open and Save dialog
			by making them remember the last path used
			so loading and saving textures from other
			paths is not so tedious. Also a few changes
			were made to the tutorial.

April 28, 2005	1.00	Wrote manual and tutorial.

April 27, 2005	1.00	Added a "Reset View" option under the tools
			menu, and the ability to switch between the
			final image and the original in the Preview
			/ Save mode.

April 27, 2005	0.99	Fixed a few problems with the perspective
			correction with non power-of-two texture
			sizes, and limited the specified texture
			sizes in the first stage to power-of-two
			texture sizes.

April 27, 2005	0.98	Finished perspective correction algorithm.

April 27, 2005	0,93	Finished perspective correction user
			interface.

April 27, 2005	0.90	Finished user interface integration (with
			the algorithms). Added save capability.

April 26, 2005	0.60	User interface design completed.
	
April 26, 2005	0.50	Finished brightness correction algorithm
			and added sharpness and contrast algorithm.
			Also greatly improved the seamless texture
			algorithm.

April 25, 2005	0.30	Finished seamless texture algorithm.

April 25, 2005	0.00	Project started.
